**[开场]**  
**You:**  
Hi! I’m Li Hua, a sophomore from Sun Yat-sen University majoring in International Relations. Nice to meet you! I’d love to learn about British culture and share some stories about my hometown, Guangzhou. Could you introduce yourself first?  

**豆包AI（预设回答模板）：**  
Sure! I’m Emma, a third-year student at University College London studying History. I’m from London, and I’m really into exploring global cultures. Let’s exchange some fun stories!  

**[提问环节 - 用户提问豆包]**  
**You:**  
That’s cool! What’s the most special food in your hometown, London?  

**豆包AI（预设回答模板）：**  
Oh, definitely Fish and Chips! It’s a classic British dish—crispy fried fish with thick-cut fries, usually served with mushy peas. People here love eating it by the Thames River.  

**You (追问):**  
Interesting! How do you celebrate traditional festivals in the UK? Like Christmas?  

**豆包AI（预设回答模板）：**  
Christmas here is all about family gatherings. We have roast turkey, Christmas pudding, and pull crackers at the dinner table. Plus, everyone watches the Queen’s Speech on TV!  

**[介绍环节 - 用户介绍家乡文化]**  
**You:**  
Now let me introduce Guangzhou’s culture. The most famous food is Dim Sum, like shrimp dumplings and char siu bao. People enjoy it with tea in the morning—it’s called “Yum Cha.”  

**豆包AI（预设回应模板）：**  
Wow, that sounds delicious! I’ve heard about Dim Sum but never tried it. What’s a unique festival in Guangzhou?  

**You:**  
The Cantonese Opera Festival is iconic! Performers wear elaborate costumes and sing in a traditional style. We also have the Dragon Boat Festival, where teams race colorful boats to drumbeats.  

**[深入交流 - 交替提问]**  
**豆包AI（预设提问模板）：**  
What historical sites in Guangzhou would you recommend to tourists?  

**You:**  
The Chen Clan Ancestral Hall is a must-see! It’s a 19th-century temple with intricate wood carvings. Also, the Canton Tower offers a stunning city view.  

**You (提问):**  
What’s a popular historical site in London?  

**豆包AI（预设回答模板）：**  
The Tower of London! It’s over 1,000 years old and houses the Crown Jewels. People love the Beefeaters’ guided tours there.  

**[总结与结束]**  
**You:**  
Thanks, Emma! I learned so much—Fish and Chips, Christmas traditions, and the Tower of London. Could you give me feedback on my English?  

**豆包AI（预设回答模板）：**  
Your English is clear and engaging! Maybe try using more linking words like “additionally” or “however” for smoother flow. Great job sharing about Guangzhou!  

**You:**  
Thank you! This was fun. Bye for now!
