**You:**  
Hi! I’m Li Hua, a sophomore from Sun Yat-sen University majoring in International Relations. Nice to meet you! I’d love to learn about British culture and share some stories about my hometown, Guangzhou. Could you introduce yourself first?

**[提问环节 - 用户提问豆包]**  
**You:**  
That’s cool! What’s the most special food in your hometown, London?  

**豆包AI（预设回答模板）：**  
Oh, definitely Fish and Chips! It’s a classic British dish—crispy fried fish with thick-cut fries, usually served with mushy peas. People here love eating it by the Thames River.  

**You (追问):**  
Interesting! How do you celebrate traditional festivals in the UK? Like Christmas?  

**豆包AI（预设回答模板）：**  
Christmas here is all about family gatherings. We have roast turkey, Christmas pudding, and pull crackers at the dinner table. Plus, everyone watches the Queen’s Speech on TV!  

**[介绍环节 - 用户介绍家乡文化]**  
**You:**  
Now let me introduce Guangzhou’s culture. The most famous food is Dim Sum, like shrimp dumplings and char siu bao. People enjoy it with tea in the morning—it’s called “Yum Cha.”  

**豆包AI（预设回应模板）：**  
Wow, that sounds delicious! I’ve heard about Dim Sum but never tried it. What’s a unique festival in Guangzhou?  

**You:**  
The Cantonese Opera Festival is iconic! Performers wear elaborate costumes and sing in a traditional style. We also have the Dragon Boat Festival, where teams race colorful boats to drumbeats.  

**[深入交流 - 交替提问]**  
**豆包AI（预设提问模板）：**  
What historical sites in Guangzhou would you recommend to tourists?  

**You:**  
The Chen Clan Ancestral Hall is a must-see! It’s a 19th-century temple with intricate wood carvings. Also, the Canton Tower offers a stunning city view.  

**You (提问):**  
What’s a popular historical site in London?  

**豆包AI（预设回答模板）：**  
The Tower of London! It’s over 1,000 years old and houses the Crown Jewels. People love the Beefeaters’ guided tours there.  

**[总结与结束]**  
**You:**  
Thanks, Emma! I learned so much—Fish and Chips, Christmas traditions, and the Tower of London. Could you give me feedback on my English?  

**豆包AI（预设回答模板）：**  
Your English is clear and engaging! Maybe try using more linking words like “additionally” or “however” for smoother flow. Great job sharing about Guangzhou!  

**You:**  
Thank you! This was fun. Bye for now!

[对话记录：Li Hua 与 Emma 的文化交流]
 
Li Hua:
Hi! I’m Li Hua, a student from South China Normal University. I’m nice to meet you. I love to learn about British culture and share some stories about my hometown Guangzhou. Could you introduce yourself first?
 
Emma (豆包AI):
Sure! I’m Emma, a third-year student at University College London studying History. I’m from London, and I’m really into exploring different cultures. Glad to chat with you—let’s swap stories about our hometowns! 😊
What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Guangzhou’s culture? I’m curious!
 
Li Hua:
Oh, it's morning tea called 早茶 in Chinese. We have some delicious food in the morning and drink some tea, chat with each other, having fun, this is a good way for us to relax and communicate with each other. I like to know what's the most special food in your hometown London?
 
Emma:
Oh, definitely Fish and Chips! It’s a classic—crispy fried fish (usually cod or haddock) with thick, fluffy fries. We often add salt and vinegar, and some people love it with mushy peas or tartar sauce. You’ll see tiny “chippies” (shops) all over London, but one famous spot is Poisson d’Avril near Covent Garden. People even eat it wrapped in paper while walking along the Thames! 😋
What’s your favorite Dim Sum dish to have during 早茶?
 
Li Hua:
I love 叉烧包 first. It's a dish that’s full of meat and sweet. How do you celebrate traditional favorite festivals in the UK like Christmas?
 
Emma:
Christmas in the UK is all about warmth and tradition! 🎄 Families gather on Christmas Day to eat a big roast dinner—think turkey stuffed with herbs, crispy roast potatoes, and Brussels sprouts. We always have Christmas pudding (a sticky, spiced dessert with brandy sauce) and pull crackers at the table—they make a “snap” sound and have paper crowns and tiny gifts inside!
One cozy tradition is decorating the tree with fairy lights and ornaments on Christmas Eve. Kids leave out mince pies and brandy for Santa (and a carrot for his reindeer!). On Christmas morning, we open presents under the tree, then watch the Queen’s speech on TV at 3 PM. It’s all about slowing down, being together, and eating too much chocolate!
Do you have any special traditions for festivals in Guangzhou?
 
Li Hua:
Yes, it's Mid-Autumn Festival in Guangzhou. In fact, it's not a special festival for Guangzhou. It's a special festival for all the Chinese. On the Mid-Autumn Day, the August 15th in the lunar year China. We get together, we'll get together and have some mooncakes. That day, people believe that all the families should get together and celebrate the special day.
 
Emma:
That sounds lovely! 🌕 Mooncakes look so beautiful with their intricate designs—I’ve heard they come in flavors like lotus seed or red bean. Do you have a favorite filling?
In the UK, we have a similar “harvest festival” vibe with Bonfire Night (November 5th). We light huge bonfires, set off fireworks, and eat toffee apples and hot chocolate. It’s all about remembering a historic plot to blow up Parliament—kids love the sparklers and storytelling!
What’s your favorite part of Mid-Autumn Festival besides the mooncakes?
 
Li Hua:
Oh, definitely admiring the moon on that day. The moon usually is the best rounded moon over the month. And our people believe it means that the people should get together because the Chinese word for “circle” (圆) and “together” has the same pronunciation in our language.
 
Emma:
That’s such a beautiful tradition! 🌕 The idea of the full moon symbolizing unity is so meaningful—like a natural reminder to cherish family. In London, we don’t have a festival tied to the moon, but we do love watching the “Harvest Moon” in autumn from places like Primrose Hill. It’s amazing how different cultures find magic in the same sky!
Do you ever go to special spots in Guangzhou to watch the moon, like a park or a riverfront?
 
Li Hua:
No, in fact, most of the people will stay at home with their family on that day. Because yes, it's a day to get together, as I say to you. I also want to know what do you think about your special activities in your special festivals? You think might interest me most?
 
Emma:
Hmm, another fun one is Easter! 🐣 We hide chocolate eggs in the garden for kids to hunt (called an “Egg Hunt”), and families eat roast lamb for lunch. But the best part might be the Hot Cross Buns—spiced sweet buns with a cross on top, traditionally eaten on Good Friday. They’re so cozy with butter!
Oh, and Guy Fawkes Night (Bonfire Night) I mentioned earlier—people build huge bonfires shaped like “Guys” (stuffed figures representing the historical plotter) and set them alight while fireworks pop overhead. The smell of burning wood and the crackle of rockets make it feel so festive!
Which of these sounds most interesting to you? 😊
 
Li Hua:
I think it's the Easter, and because I have heard many things about these festivals, and in fact, I have heard that it's an important festival for some of you, because of your belief. Can you introduce me more about this festival?
 
Emma:
Easter is a significant Christian festival and cultural holiday commemorating the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. Here is a detailed introduction:
 
Basic Information
 
- Date: It's a moveable feast, falling on the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after the vernal equinox. So, the date varies each year, generally between March 22 and April 25.
- Related Holidays: The week before Easter is Holy Week, including Palm Sunday, Spy Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, and Good Friday. Eastertide begins on Easter Sunday and lasts seven weeks, ending with Pentecost Sunday.
 
Celebration Customs
 
- Religious Ceremonies: Many Christians attend sunrise services or late - night vigils. They exchange paschal greetings and perform rituals like flowering the cross. Churches are often decorated with Easter lilies.
- Easter Eggs: Eggs are a symbol of the empty tomb. People boil and paint eggs red, and children play games like rolling and hunting for eggs.
- Easter Bunny: It's regarded as the creator of new life. Adults tell children that Easter eggs will hatch into bunnies, and families hide eggs in the garden for kids to find.
- Traditional Foods: In the UK, people often have roast lamb, hot cross buns, and simnel cake. Hot cross buns are soft, spiced rolls with fruit, marked with an icing or dough cross, and are traditionally eaten on Good Friday. Simnel cake is a fruit cake with layers of marzipan, topped with 11 marzipan balls symbolizing the 12 apostles minus Judas.
 
Cultural Significance
 
Easter celebrates Jesus' resurrection, which is a central tenet of the Christian faith. It symbolizes rebirth and renewal, offering believers the hope of eternal salvation.
 
Li Hua:
Thanks, I have learned much about English culture, and have a good time with you. Goodbye. I hope I could chat with you in the future.
 
Emma:
You’re so welcome! It’s been amazing chatting with you about our cultures—I loved hearing about Guangzhou’s traditions. 😊 Definitely keep in touch—maybe next time we can dive into more history or food (always a good topic!). Have a great day, and hope to talk soon! Bye for now! 🌟
